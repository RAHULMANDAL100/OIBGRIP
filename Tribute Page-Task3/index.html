      <h4><u>Sachin Tendulkar Biography:- </u></h4>SACHIN RAMESH TENDULKAR, born April 24, 1973, in Bombay,
      Maharashtra, is a former Indian international cricketer and is witnessed as one of the world’s best batsmen to
      date. He represented Bombay(Mumbai) in domestic cricket and India in international cricket. Sachin was
      appreciably a right-hand batsman and a bowler who can bowl both leg and off-breaks. He was known for his extreme
      batting skills and is the only player to cross 30,000 runs in International cricket. He is the only player to
      score one hundred international centuries.</p>


      <h4><u>Sachin Tendulkar’s Early Life:-</u></h4>
      <p>Tendulkar was born in Dadar, Bombay, at Nirmal Nursing Home in a Maharashtrian family. His father named
        Tendulkar after his favorite music director, Sachin Dev Buran, and he was trained under Ramakant Achrekar
        (reputed club cricketer at Shivajipark) during his school days.

        He studied at the Indian Education Society’s New English School in Bandra but on the advice of his coach, he
        shifted to Sharadashram Vidyamandir High school in Dadar, which was dominant for the cricket sport. A step from
        school cricket, he also played club cricket and later played for India’s Club Cricket.
        Later he trained in Chennai at the MRF Pace Foundation as a fast bowler, but on the advice of Dennis Lillee (he
        has taken 335 wickets in his Test career, which is a world record), he left fast bowling to concentrate on his
        batting abilities. After the recommendation of Dennis Lilee, he intensified his hard work on batting skills
        rather
        than fast bowling.</p>
